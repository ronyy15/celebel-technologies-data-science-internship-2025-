# Celebel_Summer_Internship_2025

**Company**: Celebel Technology Pvt. Ltd.
**Duration**: 2 Months
**Domain**: Data Science

# Repository Overview
This repository contains weekly assignments and tasks completed during my 2-months Data Science internship at Celebel Technology Pvt. Ltd. (2025).

Each folder represents work done in a specific week, covering Python with oops concept, data preprocessing, EDA, machine learning and Gen AI fundamentals


# Week 1: Introduction to Python
Basic Python, Syntax, Data types, Conditional Statements, Error Handling, Functions, Importing Modules and Creating Customize Modules.
**Assignment**- Create lower triangular, upper triangular and pyramid containing the "*" character.



# Week 2: Object Oriented Programming in Python
OOPs concepts including Classes and Objects, Inheritance and polymorphism, Encapsulation, Special methods, Opening, reading and writing to files, Working with CSV and JSON files, Virtual environment creations, pip, pip freeze, Flask web framework, and Django web framework.
**Assignment**- Implement a Linked List in Python Using OOP and Delete the Nth Node

- Create a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Your implementation should include the following: A Node class to represent each node in the list. A LinkedList class to manage the nodes, with methods to: Add a node to the end of the list Print the list Delete the nth node (where n is a 1-based index) Include exception handling to manage edge cases such as: Deleting a node from an empty list Deleting a node with an index out of range Test your implementation with at least one sample list.

  
# Week 3: Data Science with Python
we focused on core data science tools using Python, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We explored the basics of Machine Learning, matrix operations, and essential statistical concepts like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and Bayesian inference. We also learned data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, encoding, scaling, and handling missing values. These concepts were applied in a practical project, where we analyzed and visualized Netflix data to uncover trends in genres, ratings, duration, and regional content preferences.
**Assignment**-Take Any dataset of your choice and do the visualization



# Week 4: Feature Engineering
Learned about transforming raw data into meaningful inputs for machine learning models. It covers essential techniques like feature selection, extraction, encoding, and dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, LDA, t-SNE, and autoencoders. The week also introduces model selection strategies including train-test split, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Random Search. Lastly, it dives into key evaluation metrics for both classification (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) and regression (MSE, RMSE, R-squared) to assess model performance effectively.
**Assignment**- Conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on a complex dataset. Focus on understanding data distributions, identifying missing values, detecting outliers, and uncovering relationships between variables. Utilize visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to support your findings.



# Week 5 : Regression
Learned about Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines
**Assignment**- Data Preprocessing and feature engineering



# Week 6:  Clustering
Focusing on the key concepts of K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture ModelsBagging, Boosting, Stacking, Random Forest, Gradient BoostingL1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, ElasticNet Regularization
**Assignment**- Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Implement hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters. Analyze the results to select the best-performing model.



# Week 7:SQL Basics
Learned about basics of SQL, its installation, SQL server, different types of queries.
The week 7 assignment is live on-  https://fake-news-classifier-rahulneurobyte.streamlit.app/
**Assignment**- Develop a web application using Streamlit to deploy a trained machine learning model. The app should allow users to input data, receive predictions, and understand model outputs through visualizations. This task will help you learn how to make your models accessible and interactive.



# Week 8: Generative AI
Learned about Generative AI, its Foundation Models, LLM, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, RAG, Implementing RAG with LangChain, Fine tuning LLMs, and Vector Databases.
**Assignment**- RAG Q&A chatbot using document retrieval and generative AI for intelligent response generation (can use any light model from hugging face or a license llm(opneai, claude, grok, gemini) if free credits available
